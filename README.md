# photocaption
In this project you will create the backend for a platform for users to participate in a photo caption contest. Your server will host a few images and you will create endpoints to authenticate and authorize users. In order for a user to create a caption, they will need to be authenticated (signed-in). You will need a database design and schema in order to integrate a database layer to store all your users and captions. You will use PostgreSQL and the ORM, sequelize to communicate between your database and your server. As you create your endpoints you will be testing them on Postman to ensure that they work correctly. Once the server is running, you will use a localized cache to optimize the performance of frequently requested data. Finally, you will write the documentation using Swagger and deploy your project to Heroku.
